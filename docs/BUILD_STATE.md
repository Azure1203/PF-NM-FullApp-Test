# Perfect Fit Closets / Netley Millwork — Order Management System
## Build State Reference
> Last updated: 2026-04-12 (r21 + merged tasks #1–#26) · React + Express + PostgreSQL on Replit

---

## What This App Is

A full-stack order management and manufacturing workflow system built to replace
Allmoxy for Netley Millwork. It ingests closet order CSVs from Allmoxy, prices
every line item using admin-configured mathjs formulas and attribute grid lookups,
and produces all downstream documents needed for production, shipping, and suppliers.

## How the CSV → Order Pipeline Works

1. User drags a CSV onto the Upload page
2. Server scans `pf.records` for the row whose first cell contains `"manuf"` — that row becomes the column headers (Allmoxy CSVs have a metadata preamble before the real header)
3. Each subsequent row is a line item with a `MANU_CODE` value (the SKU)
4. SKU prefix matched against `allmoxy_products.skuPrefix` to resolve the product
5. Pricing engine fires:
   - All proxy variables, products, grid bindings, and grid rows loaded in parallel (4 bulk queries via `Promise.all`)
   - Grid bindings grouped into a `Map<productId, bindings[]>` in memory
   - Grid rows cached in a `Map<gridId, rows[]>` in memory
   - Per-item lookups are O(1) in-memory (`findGridRowInCache`) — no sequential DB queries
   - mathjs evaluates the product's pricing formula with scope: CSV dimensions + resolved grid row columns + computed proxy values
6. Line items written to `order_items` with unitPrice, totalPrice, sku, exportType, pricingError if any
7. Project and order_file records created/updated

**Performance:** Fixed in r4 — reduced from 2,363+ sequential DB queries to a fixed small number of parallel bulk queries.

## Pricing Engine — How Formulas Work

All formulas live in `proxy_variables.formula` and are evaluated by mathjs.

**Variable scope built per line item:**

| Source | How it gets in |
|---|---|
| CSV dimensions | `height`, `width`, `depth`, `quantity` from the CSV row |
| Proxy variables | Named computed values, e.g. `sq_ft = (height * width) / 92900` |
| Grid aliases | Product bound to a grid with alias `color` → `color.base_price`, `color.upcharge`, etc. |

**Formula examples:**
```
// Panel pricing with color upcharge
(base_price + max(floor_min, sq_ft) * sq_ft_price) * (1 + color.upcharge) * (1 + margin)

// Custom cut rod/rail
(price * length_in) * (1 + margin) + price_per_cut

// Flat hardware
item.price * (1 + item.margin)
```

Comments (`//`) are stripped before evaluation. The Formula Tester page lets admins test any formula live.

---

## Output Documents & Exports

All generated from `order_items`. Routed by `exportType` field on each product.

| Export | Type Tag | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Invoice PDF | — | Priced line items + totals |
| Customer Packing Slip PDF | — | Customer-facing slip |
| Internal Packing Slip PDF | — | Internal production slip |
| ELIAS Export | `ELIAS` | Supplier-specific format |
| MJ Export | `MJ` | M&J Woodcraft format |
| ERP Export | — | Component + hardware lines |
| CTS Export | `CTS` | Cut-to-size parts list |
| Cabinet Vision .ORD | `ORD` | CNC production file (header configurable via ORD Settings page) |
| Hardware Export | `HARDWARE` | Hardware line items |
| Glass Export | `GLASS` | Glass line items |

---

## Product Images

- **Storage:** Base64 text in `image_data` column in PostgreSQL — no object storage dependency
- **List endpoints** (`getAllmoxyProducts`, `getProducts`): explicitly exclude `imageData` column — safe to call with 2,363+ products
- **Single-product endpoints** (`getProduct`, `getProductByCode`): return full record including `imageData`
- **Serve routes:** `GET /api/product-images/by-id/:id` (Allmoxy), `GET /api/product-images/hardware/by-id/:id` (hardware)
- **Bulk uploader** at `/admin/product-images`: matches uploaded filenames to products by name/SKU prefix/hardware code; client-side batching (25 files/batch) with live progress bar

---

## Integrations (All Live)

| Integration | How | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Asana** | OAuth via Replit Connectors | Syncs orders as tasks; auto-imports from "NEW JOBS" project; background scheduler every 5 min |
| **Outlook** | OAuth via Replit Connectors | Auto-fetches packing slip PDFs + hardware CSV attachments; polls every 30 min |

## Known Gaps — Spec Defined, Not Yet Built

| Gap | Impact |
|---|---|
| `allmoxy_products` missing: `isCustomCut`, `isHardware`, `supplierName`, `active` columns | Custom-cut and hardware routing relies on manual `exportType` config instead |
| `order_items` missing: `formulaSnapshot`, `variableSnapshot`, `colorCode` | No pricing audit trail |
| `proxy_variables` missing: `description` column | Admins can't annotate what a formula does in the UI |
| `attribute_grids` missing: `displayName`, `updatedAt` columns | Grid list shows raw name only |
| `attribute_grid_rows` missing: `sortOrder` column | Grid rows appear in DB insert order only |
| Pricing audit trail | Formula + variable snapshots not stored at calculation time |

---

## Release History

### r19 — 2026-04-05
**Fix (critical):** Removed `overflow-hidden` from outer `<div>` wrapper and `<main>` in `AppLayout.tsx` — was silently clipping the `overflow-y-auto` scroll container, preventing scroll on the Order Details page.
**Fix:** "Download .ORD" button replaced with `window.location.href` to backend endpoint — old client-side assembly code (header template fetch + groupByFile + Blob) deleted; button now uses `GET /api/orders/:id/download/ord` (multi-room format, r16).
**Added:** Output Settings page (`/admin/output-settings`) — GET/PUT endpoints + new frontend page with per-document toggle switches (showProductImages, showPricing). Settings stored as `output.<page>.<key>` in `app_settings`.
**Fixed:** PDF page break formatting — `KeepTogether` now applied for small sections (≤ 6 items) across 5 Python PDF generators. `KeepTogether` import added to elias, mj, and cts scripts.

### r18 — 2026-04-05
**Fix (critical):** `gridNameMap` construction — added sort so grids with date suffixes (the current active ones) are always written last into the map, guaranteeing they overwrite any old/empty grid that produces the same normalized key. Old `Shelves` (0 rows) can no longer shadow `Shelves 02202026` (47 rows).
**Added:** `GET /api/admin/duplicate-grids` — diagnostic endpoint listing all grids that share a base name after stripping the date suffix, with row counts, so stale/empty duplicates can be identified and deleted via the Grid Manager.

### r17 — 2026-04-05
**Fix (critical):** `findGridForAlias` — replaced single-pass `includes()` with a 3-pass priority system: (1) exact match, (2) starts-with (date suffix tolerance), (3) contains fallback. Previously `shelves` matched "Corner Shelves" before "Shelves", putting all shelves-dependent products on the wrong grid and generating zero correct bindings. After deploying: run "Reset & Recreate Bindings" on the Diagnostic page, then "Re-run Pricing" on the affected order.

### Merged Tasks (task agents, 2026-04-12)

**Task #1 — ORD Header Template & Settings Infrastructure**
Added `app_settings` table (27th DB table) with `getSetting` / `setSetting` / `getAllSettings` storage methods. Seeded default ORD `[Header]` template at startup. Added `GET/PUT /api/admin/settings/:key` endpoints. Added `generateOrdHeader()` to `ordExporter.ts`. ORD Settings page (`/admin/settings`) shows a textarea editor for the header template with `{{design_name}}` / `{{po_number}}` placeholder hints.

**Task #2 — Port Production Workflow Features**
`productsMap` is now passed to `countPartsFromCSV` in the upload handler so M&J/Richelieu door detection works correctly. Reprice endpoint now calls both checklist generators for every file after pricing. Added `GET /api/orders/:id/files` endpoint. Added `POST /api/orders/:id/regenerate-checklists` endpoint + "Regenerate Checklists" button on Order Details.

**Task #3 — Surface Features via Sidebar Navigation**
"All Orders" (`/orders`) and "Users" (`/admin/users`) added to sidebar. Page title resolver updated for both. Email Sync card removed from Order Processing Dashboard (controls live on `/orders` page).

**Task #6 — Bulk Grid Upload + Multi-Select Delete**
`POST /api/admin/upload-dynamic-grids-bulk` — accepts multiple CSV files; derives grid name from filename automatically. `DELETE /api/admin/attribute-grids/bulk` — accepts `{ ids: number[] }` and deletes all. Grid Manager left panel redesigned: multi-file dropzone (no name input), "Upload All" button with per-file results, checkbox-based selection mode with "Delete X grids" confirmation.

**Task #8 — Export Type Field**
`export_type` column added to `allmoxy_products` and `order_items`. Product Manager edit form has an "Export Type" dropdown. Product list shows colored export-type badges (ORD=blue, HARDWARE=gray, ELIAS=green, MJ=purple, CTS=orange, GLASS=cyan). `POST /api/admin/products/auto-classify-export-types` applies SKU-prefix classification rules to all active products. `export_type` is propagated from product to `order_items` at upload time.

**Task #9 — Bulk Formula Seed & Setup Wizard**
`POST /api/admin/seed-formulas` — creates or updates all ~55 pricing and export proxy variables from the hardcoded spec list; returns `{ created, updated, total }`. `POST /api/admin/products/auto-assign-formulas` — for each active product, matches its SKU prefix to the correct proxy variables and creates grid bindings via fuzzy name matching; accepts `overwrite` boolean; returns `{ formulasAssigned, bindingsCreated, skipped, errors }`.

**Task #10 — Bulk Product Image Uploader**
Initial bulk image uploader at `/admin/product-images`. Drag-and-drop multiple image files; uploads to object storage; matches by filename prefix/partial against both Allmoxy and hardware product tables; preview table with confidence badges; "Save X Image Assignments" confirm step.

**Task #11 — Internal Packing Slip PDF**
`server/scripts/generate_internal_packing_slip.py` — internal production document with rack location column (resolved from product grid bindings). `GET /api/orders/:id/pdf/internal-packing-slip` endpoint. "Internal Packing Slip" PDF iframe tab on Order Details.

**Task #12 — Cut-to-Size PDF**
`server/scripts/generate_cut_to_size.py` — PDF with "DO NOT SEND WITH JOB" header, length summary table (unique lengths × qty), item detail table (ID/Qty/Length/Buyout or Stock?/Rack Location), item totals (total mm/in/rods). `GET /api/orders/:id/pdf/cut-to-size` endpoint. "Cut-to-Size PDF" tab on Order Details, visible only when CTS items exist.

**Task #13 — M&J Shaker Door PDF**
`server/scripts/generate_mj_pdf.py` — "NETLEY 5 PIECE SHAKER JOB LIST"; Letter-size pages; sections for drawer fronts, doors, and glass (each with Supplier/Premoule label, X checkmarks, item table); no pricing. `GET /api/orders/:id/pdf/mj` endpoint. "M&J Shaker PDF" tab on Order Details visible when MJ or GLASS items exist.

**Task #16 — Bulk Image Uploader Redesign (Parallel Upload + Auto-Save)**
Rewrote bulk upload backend to: build in-memory product map first, match by exact filename-without-extension (case-insensitive) only, upload matched files to GCS in parallel batches of 10, write `image_path` to the product row in the same step. No separate confirm step. Frontend redesigned: single "Upload & Save" button, loading spinner, two-section results (Saved ✓ / Unmatched ✗).

**Task #17 — Per-Product Image Upload in Product Editor**
Image thumbnail in Allmoxy product editor is now clickable. Selecting a file uploads immediately and updates the thumbnail. A "×" button clears the image. List thumbnails update after upload via TanStack Query cache invalidation.

**Tasks #19–#22 — GCS Upload Fix Iterations**
Multiple attempts to fix GCS object storage uploads (signed URL approach, sidecar token passing, GCS client library). All failed due to broken GCS environment.

**Task #23 — Store Product Images in Database (Final Solution)**
GCS abandoned. `image_data` text column added to `allmoxy_products` (base64-encoded bytes). Both single and bulk upload routes now write base64 to `image_data` column (no GCS calls). New image serve routes: `GET /api/product-images/by-id/:id` and `GET /api/product-images/hardware/by-id/:id`. Frontend updated to use ID-based URLs. `image_path` retained as filename reference only.

**Task #24 — Fix CSV Import Crash on Duplicate Product Names**
After building `productsToInsert` from the CSV rows, a `Map<name, ...>` deduplication step now runs before the upsert — last occurrence of any duplicate name wins. Eliminates the "ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect a row a second time" PostgreSQL crash.

**Task #26 — Fix Product List — Stop Sending Image Data**
`getAllmoxyProducts()` and `getProducts()` in `server/storage.ts` now explicitly select all columns except `imageData` using Drizzle's column selection syntax. Eliminates the multi-hundred-MB response that caused page timeouts after all 2,363 product images were stored in DB.

### r21 — 2026-04-05
**Feature:** ORD format overhaul — `GET /api/orders/:id/download/ord` rewritten. One `.ord` file per CSV file; single file → single `.ord` download, multiple files → ZIP (via `archiver`). Each `.ord` has its own `[Header]` populated from the stored template using that file's PO number. Standard 8-field cabinet lines (`1,"SKU",W,H,D,"hinge","type",QTY`), entry number always `1`, no `[Walls]` section, `\r\n` line endings. OrdTab button updates to "Download ORD Files (.ZIP)" or "Download .ORD" based on `downloadFormat` field from `/data/ord` endpoint.

### r16 — 2026-04-05
**Feature:** Cabinet Vision ORD — initial multi-room implementation (later superseded by r21). One combined `.ord` file with `[Header]`, `[Walls]`, 18-field extended cabinet lines (room number in field 14), global sequential entry numbers, `Note=` banding.
**Feature:** `/data/ord` now returns room-grouped structure `{ projectName, rooms[], totalItems, total }` instead of flat `items[]` + `assembledOrdText`.
**Feature:** OrdTab redesigned — room-labelled sections, "Multi-Room" badge, download via server-side endpoint, removed raw text preview.
**Feature:** Missing-alias diagnostic logging in upload handler — logs unresolved formula aliases with binding list for the first 3 matched items per upload.
**Fix:** Scrolling hardened — added `min-height: 100vh; overflow-y: auto` to `html, body, #root` in `index.css`.

### r15 — 2026-04-05
**Fix:** Page scrolling — `h-full` on the `max-w-7xl` content wrapper in `AppLayout.tsx` was capping the scrollable area to exactly the viewport height, preventing `overflow-y-auto` from ever activating. Changed to `min-h-full`; moved `p-8` inside the wrapper.
**Fix:** `DEFAULT_ORD_HEADER_TEMPLATE` updated with quoted values and `Customer`/`Address1` fields for Cabinet Vision compatibility.
**Fix:** `/api/orders/:id/data/ord` now filters to `exportType === 'ORD'` items only and prepends the generated `[Header]` block to `assembledOrdText`. Cabinet Vision tab download now produces a fully-formed `.ord` file.
**Added:** `GET /api/orders/:id/download/ord` — server-side file download endpoint returning the assembled `.ord` file as an attachment.
**Fix:** MANU_CODE grid bindings — when `lookupColumn` contains `"manu"`, the pipeline now uses the already-extracted SKU string instead of attempting to look up a non-existent `item['MANU_CODE']` CSV column. Applied to both upload and reprice pipelines. Also added `item['COLOR']` uppercase fallback in color resolution chain.

### r14 — 2026-04-03
**Fix (critical):** CSV column name mismatch — `Manuf code` (lowercase 'c') was not matched by any SKU extraction variant, causing `if (!sku) continue` to skip every row and produce zero order items on every upload. Also fixed `Width(R)`, `Length(L)`, `Quantity` column names for dimensions. Applied across all 3 pipeline locations (upload handler, reprice route, Asana scheduler).
**Fix:** Color binding `lookupColumn` changed from `'Material'` → `'Color'` in auto-create-bindings to match actual CSV column name. Per-pipeline fallback was already handling this correctly.
**Fix:** Description field now falls back to `item['Manuf code']` when NAME/Part Name/Description absent.
**Added:** `GET /api/test/order-check/:id` — diagnostic endpoint returning item count, sample items with prices, total price, and error count for quick post-upload verification.

### r13 — 2026-04-03
**Feature:** 6 new JSON data endpoints — `/api/orders/:id/data/{invoice,elias,mj,hardware,glass,ord}` — serve structured JSON for order output data consumed by tab components.
**Refactor:** Order Details page fully redesigned with a persistent 12-tab layout. Replaced "Pricing & Export" and "Output Documents" collapsibles (~560 lines removed) with a `<Tabs>` bar. Overview tab holds all management sections; each output format has its own dedicated tab. 10 new self-contained tab components created in `client/src/pages/order-tabs/`.
**Cleanup:** Removed `pricingOpen`, `outputDocsOpen`, `activeOutputTab`, `fileFilter` states and lazy export queries from `OrderDetails.tsx`; `fileFilter` now managed inside `AllItemsTab`.

### r12 — 2026-04-03
**Fix (critical):** Console log flood — `evaluatePrice()` was calling `console.log` twice per item (formula text + full JSON scope), burying `[Upload Pipeline]` checkpoints in thousands of lines on large CSVs. Removed both per-item logs; simplified catch block to single `[PricingEngine] FAILED SKU="X": msg` line. Removed per-item match log from upload handler inner loop.
**Feature:** Pipeline complete summary — 5-line block logged after `savedItems` is fetched: PIPELINE COMPLETE / Project id+name / Files processed / Total order items / Total price.
**Feature:** Per-file filter on Order Details items table — pill buttons above table when project has >1 file; filters `orderItems` by `fileId`; summary row switches between "File Subtotal" and "Grand Total" and shows parenthetical order total when filtered.
**Feature:** "Output Documents" collapsible card on Order Details — tabbed section with inline PDF viewers (`<iframe>`) for Invoice, Packing Slips, CTS, Elias PDF, M&J PDF; lazily-fetched CSV code blocks for Elias, M&J, ERP exports; ORD assembled from items in-memory; Hardware/Glass filtered item tables. Only tabs with content shown. Each tab has a Download button.
**Docs:** Added 3-line comment to `POST /api/admin/products/bulk-upload-images` documenting intentional DB/base64 storage strategy (GCS unavailable).

### r11 — 2026-03-30
**Feature:** `GET /api/admin/import-readiness` — fast pre-flight health check returning: products (total/active/withSkuPrefix/withPricing/withExport), grids (count/totalRows/names), bindings (total/productsWithBindings), proxyVariables (total/pricing/export), `ready: bool`, `issues: string[]`.
**Feature:** Upload page readiness banner — fetches import-readiness on load; shows amber warning with bullet-pointed issues when `ready === false`; shows green confirmation when ready. Includes counts of products with pricing and bindings.
**Feature:** Upload page results summary — after successful upload, shows project name, total items processed, SKU matches, unmatched SKUs, pricing success count, pricing errors, total price. Replaced auto-redirect with explicit "Go to Dashboard" button.
**Logging:** `[Upload Pipeline]` logs added at 6 checkpoints in the upload handler: pre-load totals (products/bindings/grids/proxy vars + ⚠ if zero), header row detection (index + columns or 5-row debug dump), data rows parsed (first item MANU_CODE + Material), per-item SKU match/no-match (first 5 no-matches shown), pricing error (first 3 shown), per-file summary (parsed/matched/no-match/success/error/batch size), batch insert confirmation.
**Logging:** `[Reprice Pipeline]` logs added with the same structure in the reprice route.
**Refactor:** `useUploadOrder` no longer auto-redirects on success — navigation handled by the component after the results summary is shown.

### r10b — 2026-03-29
**Fix (critical):** Grid name matching bug in `auto-create-bindings` endpoint — alias patterns like `main_color_attribute` were failing to match grid names with spaces (`Main Color Attribute 02202026`), causing the `color` alias to fall through to `mj_colors` (wrong grid). Fixed by storing 4 normalized variants per grid in `gridNameMap` and normalizing both sides to underscores before `includes()` comparison. Also fixed date-suffix stripping regex to handle space-separated dates.
**Feature:** `reset: true` parameter on auto-create-bindings — deletes all existing auto-created bindings (by known alias list) before recreating fresh. Clears ~1,790 wrong bindings from previous broken runs.
**Feature:** Wrong-grid detection in pricing diagnostic — explicitly flags `color` bindings pointing to MJ Colors grid as errors.
**Feature:** "Reset & Recreate Bindings" (destructive red) button on Pricing Diagnostic page — runs delete + recreate in one shot, shows deleted/created counts.

### r10 — 2026-03-28
**Feature:** Formula Tester auto-select — non-MANU grid bindings (color, material, etc.) now auto-select the first available row key when a product is chosen; `autoSelect` prop added to `GridRowCombobox`.
**Feature:** Formula Tester diagnostic banner — on page load, fetches pricing diagnostic stats; shows amber warning when `withPricingProxy` or `withBindings` is 0, with link to Diagnostic page.

### r9 — 2026-03-28
**Feature:** `GET /api/admin/pricing-diagnostic` — full health check across all active products; returns stats (6+4 cards) + per-product issue list (severity: error/warning) + formula-alias cross-reference.
**Feature:** `POST /api/admin/auto-create-bindings` (with `dryRun` support) — analyzes product pricing/export formulas for alias refs, maps to grids via `aliasToGridPatterns` dictionary (50+ patterns), creates missing `ProductGridBinding` rows. Color-type aliases use `lookupColumn: 'Material'`; all others use `MANU_CODE`. Idempotent.
**Feature:** Pricing Diagnostic page (`/admin/diagnostic`) — stats grid, severity-filtered issue table, dry-run → confirm binding creation flow with sample table + skipped list collapsibles.
**Feature:** Formula Tester binding status panel — shows ✅/❌ per alias referenced in pricing formula vs. bound grids; `formatPricingError()` parses "Undefined symbol" errors with contextual guidance.
**Nav:** "Pricing Diagnostic" added to admin sidebar (Zap icon).

### r8 — 2026-03-26
**Fix (Bug 2):** Non-MANU bindings in formula-test endpoint incorrectly used `autoValue = skuPrefix`; changed to empty string so the grid lookup uses the user-supplied `gridLookups[alias]` value.
**Fix (Bug 3):** Case-insensitive fallback column matching added to `findGridRowInCache` in all three pipeline locations (upload, reprice, Asana scheduler) — `divider_panels.BASE_PRICE` now resolves when formula says `divider_panels.base_price`.
**Fix (Bug 4):** Batch insert for order items — `createOrderItemsBatch()` added to storage interface + implementation; all three pipeline locations now accumulate items in an array and bulk-insert after the loop instead of one-by-one.
**Fix (Bug 5):** Replaced all inline `Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(rawData).map(...))` with `gridRowToScope()` helper — normalizes all rowData keys to lowercase AND coerces numeric strings to numbers.
**Feature:** `gridRowToScope()` helper added to `pricingEngine.ts`.
**Feature:** Formula Tester combobox for non-MANU bindings — `GridRowCombobox` component uses `GET /api/admin/attribute-grids/:id/row-keys` endpoint; replaces free-text input with searchable popover dropdown; ad-hoc lookups also use it.

### r6 — 2026-03-21
**Fix:** `stripComments` now collapses internal whitespace — multi-line formulas with newlines before `?` or branches no longer throw "Syntax error (char N)"
**Feature:** Formula Tester "Grid Lookup Overrides" — per-binding inputs for non-SKU lookup columns (color, material, etc.); auto-resolved bindings show read-only pill; `gridLookups` sent separately from `inputs` in request body

### r5 — 2026-03-21

**Prompt 1 — Grid row cache in all three pipeline locations**
- `findGridRowInCache` + `gridRowsCache` added to reprice route and Asana scheduler (was only in upload handler)
- Per-product `getProductGridBindings` sequential loops replaced with `getAllProductGridBindings()` bulk fetch + `Promise.all` in both locations
- All three locations now lowercase `binding.alias` and all rowData column keys when building `contextScope` — fixes alias lookup mismatches like `Parts` vs `parts`
- Asana scheduler `createOrderItem` now stores normalized numeric dimensions from `pricingItem` instead of raw CSV strings

**Prompt 2 — Proxy variable values pre-computed into formula scope**
- `evaluatePrice` in `pricingEngine.ts` accepts an optional 4th arg `allProxyVars: Array<{name, formula}>`
- Before evaluating the main formula, every proxy variable is evaluated in order and its result added to the mathjs scope — so formulas can reference `sq_ft`, `margin`, and other named proxy vars by name
- Errors re-thrown instead of silently returning `0` — callers' existing `try/catch` blocks populate `pricingError`; Formula Tester UI shows them in a red box (already existed)
- All callers pass `[...proxyVarMap.values()]` as the 4th argument: upload handler, reprice route, Asana scheduler, formula tester endpoint
- Full scope JSON logged to console before each evaluation; formula + scope logged on error

### r4 — 2026-03-21

**Task #26 — Fix product list timeout**
- Added `AllmoxyProductListItem` and `ProductListItem` DTO types (`Omit<..., 'imageData'>`) to `shared/schema.ts`
- Rewrote `getAllmoxyProducts()` and `getProducts()` in `server/storage.ts` with explicit Drizzle column projection excluding `imageData`
- Updated `IStorage` interface return types to match
- No forced type casts — Drizzle infers correctly from the column selection
- Eliminates hundreds-of-MB responses that were crashing the browser and timing out the Products page and Formula Tester

**Task #25 — Fix zero order_items bug + pipeline performance**
- Fixed header-aware CSV parsing: scans `pf.records` for the `"manuf"` header row instead of treating the metadata preamble as headers
- Added `getAllProductGridBindings()` — one bulk SELECT replacing 2,363+ sequential per-product queries
- Pre-load now runs 4 table fetches in parallel via `Promise.all`
- `findGridRowInCache` in-memory arrow function replaces per-item DB calls for grid row lookups

**Task #24 — Allmoxy product import deduplication**
- CSV rows are deduplicated by name (last row wins) before the database upsert call
- Eliminates "ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE command cannot affect a row a second time" crash on duplicate-name CSVs

**Task #23 — Allmoxy product import upsert**
- Re-importing no longer crashes on duplicate names or wipes proxy assignments, images, or SKU prefixes
- New products inserted; existing products updated (exportType, supplyType, categoryId, proxy IDs); admin-configured fields preserved; products absent from CSV left untouched
